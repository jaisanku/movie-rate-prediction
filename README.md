# movie-rate-prediction
To build a model that predicts movie ratings, i was follow these steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Convert categorical features (like genre, director, and actors) into numerical representations.
Normalize or scale the features if necessary.
Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features based on the existing columns (e.g., encoding genres, handling multiple actors).
Possibly reduce dimensionality or combine features for better model performance.
Model Selection:

Use regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
Optimization:

Tune hyperparameters to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
Consider cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Let's start by preprocessing the data. I'll handle the missing values and convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.

The dataset has been preprocessed. The categorical variables have been converted to numerical representations using one-hot encoding, resulting in a large number of features (12,060 columns). We also dropped the Name, Year, Duration, and Votes columns as they are less likely to directly influence the rating prediction.

Next, I'll proceed to split the data into training and testing sets and build a regression model to predict the movie ratings. Let's start with a basic linear regression model and evaluate its performance.
Mean Squared Error: 1.805338280702935e+26
R-squared: -9.710582790104246e+25
